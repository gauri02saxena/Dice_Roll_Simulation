# GUI Dice Roll Simulation

## Reference Article

** Please refer to my article on GeeksforGeeks: [GUI Dice Roll Simulation using Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gui-dice-roll-simulation-using-python/). **

## Description

"GUI Dice Roll Simulation" is a fun and interactive Tkinter project that simulates the rolling of dice. This Python-based application offers a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can virtually roll two dices and see the outcome. It's an excellent example of combining simple programming concepts with graphical elements to create an engaging application.

## Features

- **Interactive Dice Rolling:** Users can roll two dices by clicking a button, with the outcome displayed graphically.
- **Randomized Outcomes:** The application uses the `random` module to ensure that each roll yields a different, random result.
- **Customizable Appearance:** The window features a sleek design with a black background, vibrant button colors, and large, easily readable dice symbols.
- **Fixed Window Size:** The window size is set to optimize the display and prevent resizing for consistent user experience.

## Implementation Details

- **Tkinter Module:** Utilizes Tkinter for creating the GUI, demonstrating the versatility of this standard Python library.
- **Unicode Dice Symbols:** Implements Unicode characters to represent dice faces, providing a clear and visually appealing way to display results.
- **Button to Trigger Rolls:** Includes a 'Roll!' button that, when clicked, triggers the dice roll, showcasing event handling in Tkinter.
- **Non-Resizable Window:** The window is designed to be non-resizable, ensuring that the layout remains consistent regardless of the user environment.

## Usage

1. Start the Python script to launch the GUI.
2. Click the 'Roll!' button to roll the dices.
3. View the randomly generated outcome as two dice faces on the screen.
